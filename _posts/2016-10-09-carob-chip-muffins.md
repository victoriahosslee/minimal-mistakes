##### Captain's Log #3

##### Date: Five months (with no cheats) on AIP




----------
Every Sunday after the service, my church serves coffee and pastries. Well five months of abstaining and I could seriously taste those luscious blueberry muffins melting in my mouth. You know, the *really* unhealthy ones, with refined sugars and flours, streusel on top, absolutely no nutritional value outside of the blueberries? Oh ya and it has to be about the size of your face? You know those blueberry muffins? Well I was dying for one. Seriously considered grabbing one and running before the hubbs could bring me to my senses.

Luckily for me, my stomach, my skins, and all of my joints, I remembered that gluten and sugar and dairy and God know what else was in that thing, all cause inflammation in my body. So instead of pulling a fast one, I plotted. I stood there and plotted, "How can I make the most unhealthy tasting muffin possible without breaking AIP?" I didn't know. I went home and still didn't know. I searched Google and Pintrest for "AIP Blueberry Muffins" and still didn't know. There were more than half a dozen recipes, but they all looked healthy. I didn't want healthy. I wanted "Oh man this is so freaking good I can't believe life is this awesome" unhealthy. So I did the unthinkable.

I took the most unhealthy, in the best way, recipe I could find for regular blueberry muffins and I just swapped everything for AIP compliant ingredients. Oh and I didn't have any blueberries. **Oops!** Thank God I made a double batch of carob chips a few months ago. I whipped those out of the fridge and dumped 'em in, waited the most anxious 25 minutes of every cooks life, and then, VIOLA! When you bite into them, they actually feel like a gluten muffin. They have a glorious crumb, if I do say so myself. And they taste so indulgent that I've been feeling guilty in a great way all week. Now to see if I can get myself to save some for the next time I get desperate, or if I'm just going to finish them in five days like the champion that I am.


### Muffins
* 1 cup of cassava flour

* 1/2 cup of tigernut flour

* 1/2 cup of coconut flour

* 2 gelatin eggs

* 1/2 tsp of baking soda

* 1 tsp of cream of tarter

* 1/2 cup +2 tbs of vegetable shortening

* 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

* 1/4 tsp salt

* 1 cup maple sugar

* 1/2 cup of coconut milk

* 1 cup of carob chips or 2 1/2 cups blueberries (frozen or fresh)

### Topping
* 1 tbs of maple sugar

* 1 tsp of cinnamon

* 1 tsp fat of some kind


1. Heat oven to 375Â°.
2. Grease 12 regular-size muffin cups with coconut oil.
3. In bowl, mix shortening until creamy. Add sugar and beat until well combined.
4. Beat in vanilla, baking soda, cream of tarter, and salt.
5. In a small bowl combine cassava flour, tigernut flour, coconut flour, and coconut milk. It will be clumpy and not well incorporated prated just do your best to have it evenly distributed.
6. Start mixer on medium speed. Slowly incorporate flour and milk mixture. Your blender may struggle here, so use a spatula to help it out if needed.
7. Pour two tbs of cool water in a medium bowl, then sprinkle tbs of gelatin on top. Then bring some water to a boil. When it reaches a boil, pour four tbs of boiling water on top of the bloomed gelatin. Whisk until frothy.
8. Scrape the flour mixture off of the whisk/paddle. Start the mixer on low speed, then slowly add the gelatin egg.
9. When mostly combined, stop mixer and scrape dough together.
10. Fold in carob chips or blueberries.
11. Spoon into muffin cups and sprinkle topping onto each muffin.
12. Bake 25 minutes, check at 20 minutes to ensure they aren't browning too much. If they are, cover loosely in foil. You'll know they are done when you you feel some resistance on your tooth-pic/cake tester.

If you like the crumb on this, I think it should work in other similar muffin/scone recipes. Let me know if you give it a try!
