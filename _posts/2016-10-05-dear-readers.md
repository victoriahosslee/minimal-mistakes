It is currently October 5th, 2016 at 3:22 PM EST. The current blog population of the internet sits at around 1234567890xyz0987654321 and counting. So why on earth did I decide to add to the cacophony of blogs?

For starters the abundance of fantastic blogs out there have changed my life. I'm sure they've changed yours too. From recipes, to healing diets, self-care tips, and devotional reviews, the majority of positive life changes I've gone through over the past few years have originated in something I read on a blog.

Secondly, there's also a decent amount of stuff out there that makes me say, "Wha? What? What?!" Now, I am 100% certain that at least one person will have that response to me, and I accept that at the outset. However, I think it's important for a myriad of voices to make themselves heard. That's the whole, big, beautiful thing about the internet.

Finally, I have found surprising peace and power in sharing my journey. Is my voice or my narrative perfect, superior, or even interesting? Definitely not the first two. The third option is up to you. In fact, my hope is that this will grow more into a community, a place for many, varied voices to come together. I want to share with you what I've learned, but I also desperately need to learn from you. Looking back at my life, I can trace every major moment of growth to a woman who helped me get there. I believe that when women come together, share our stories, and encourage each other, miraculous things can happen.

With all of this bouncing around in my brain, I want to be explicit about my plans and hopes for this space. Anytime we present ourselves to others, we have to think about the ways our words and choices come across. I know that I will not always perfectly explain myself, and I may make choices that people don't agree with. However, if I try to clarify now where my heart lies and what my intentions are, I hope that will smooth over anything that follows.

## So here are my promises to you Dear Reader:

### Promise #1: I promise to always come to you in love.

A wise woman, my mom, once shared a theory with me: Everything in life boils down to one of two things, love or fear. Every motive, action, word, can be traced back to one of those two feelings. Now, it could be complicated and it could be a mix of these two things, but if you're really honest, that's what it comes down to. While I love the fact that the internet and social media gives each of use the ability to share our voice, it also has created an environment of exaggerated popularity contests. How many followers do I have? How many likes did my post get? Etc. Etc. Etc. I am so bad about this. You guys, it's terrible. Some days I wake up and check my likes before anything else. That is not good. That is an example of fear. Fear of inadequacy, fear of rejection, the list goes on. Living like that will never fulfill me and frankly it's not that interesting to read. So, for your sake and mine, I promise to only sharing things motivated by love.

Moreover, Christ makes it exceedingly clear that our only job in life is to love.

>[Matthew 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22&version=NKJV) 37 Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’[a] 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] 40 On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.”

>[John 13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+13&version=KJV) 34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.

Therefore, I will try my hardest to let the love of Christ permeate everything that happens here, to share only things that are edifying. Things that carry intrinsic value beyond myself. Things that aren't written just to get attention, shares, or anything else. If I don't truly believe that what I'm writing will be beneficial to you, I won't write it.

### Promise #2: I promise to always be honest with you.

This follows so closely to the last promise that it's almost the same, but I'm trying to be explicit here. I plan to post reviews here of various things, from food, to devotional books, to yarn. I will very likely include affiliate links to the things I am reviewing, and I may make some money off of those links. However, I want you to know that I will never exaggerate how much I like something, let alone flat out lie about it. All reviews will be honest because why? That's right, because I love you.

Also, you may noticed that the aesthetics of this blog appear less polished than others. That's because it's important for me that the pictures I share be an honest representation of my life. Not what I wish it looked like, not what I can make it looks like with a few props and every lap in my home lighting it up. First of all, I don't have time to spend hours setting up photos. Second of all, my apartment gets zero direct sunlights, so that's some rough lighting. Thirdly, I'm tired of trying to hold myself to the perfect food stylists standard. I want to cook, snap a quick picture, and then devour the whole thing before it gets cold. Don't get me wrong, I have ENORMOUS respect for people who take polished food photos, I'm just not that person. It's not a skill I have, and I'm not going to waste any of our time trying to make it look like I do. So if you're like me, and your food is never quite Insta-worthy, cut yourself some slack and take some [Martha Stewart pictures](https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelzarrell/someone-needs-to-tell-martha-stewart-her-food-tweets-are-dis?utm_term=.bl4rvN1NA#.acGag4p4V).

### Promise #3: I promise to not take myself too seriously.

This means acknowledging my flaws, mistakes, and eccentricities. It also means having fun. I hope this is a space that you can come to when you're in need of a smile or when you have smiles to share. I'll try to be funny, but hopefully not too hard. We'll see what happens.

### Promise #4: I promise to involve you.

If you ever have an idea for a post that you would like me to write, or you would like to add to the blog, just let me know.
