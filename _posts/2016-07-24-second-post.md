Why I started knitting and you should too!

Admission the first: I'm a judger. I'm working on it.

When I was in high school a lovely girl, too pure to be hanging out with the likes of me, offered to teach me how to knit. Obviously, being the wannabe cool girl that I was, I judged the heck out of her, laughed, said "nope!", and walked away. WHAT A FOOL I WAS!

Admission the second: I have wasted years of my life.

Until now, my life has consisted of two mode. On mode was school and work, go go go go go go go. Then *BOOM* I would hit the wall and slam into off mode, which consisted entirely of TV. I've never in my life had a real hobby, something that existed between on and off, something relaxing but engaging and meaningful. Sure there are things that I like to do, exercise, cook, read etc., but all of those are really things that I should be doing anyway, *to get gold stars on my adulting sticker chart (If only someone would make one for me)*.

I've never done something that I didn't have to do, other than passively staring at a screen for hours on end. Not that that's always a bad thing. I will defend my right to binge watch Doctor Who and still be considered a productive member of society until I go blind, and maybe even then. But after more than 12 years of this, I've learned that at a certain point too much T.V. leads to headaches, guilt, and boredom with even the best shows. More than this though, the more rest time that my disease forces into my life, the more I desperately want to fight back, the more I want to take that time and turn it into something I'm proud of.

Chronic illness steals so much from life, but I usually miss my sense of accomplishment the most. I thrive of completing checklists and admiring the products of my labor. That's part of why I love to cook, because art is most admirable when it's edible. But when your body demands that you rest, when off mode becomes mandatory and on mode a privilege, you long for something in between. That's exactly what knitting has become for me! It's not work. I can do it while sitting or even laying down, but it still engages my brain. Each piece is a puzzle, and the final product can be shared with the ones I love. It's the coolest!

Things that are cool about knitting:

* you get to make stuff
* the stuff you make is warm and cozy
* it's actually really fun to pull it apart when you mess up
* Oh ya, and it's great of maintaining dexterity when doing battle with your immune system *boo yah!*

I've also learned that knitters come in every variety possible. I've been wowed by how much free information is out there. People love this art form and they love sharing it. If you're curious, I recommend checking [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/newstitchaday) for beginners videos and [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/search#craft=knitting) for more patterns than you could knit in a lifetime.

If you're hooked, check out [Budget Girl](http://www.diybudgetgirl.com/basic-knitting-supplies-for-beginners/) for a list of where to start. Finally, I post all of the patterns I'm working on and quick reference guides on [my knitting board on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/victoriaehoss/knitting/).

I want to hear from you! Why did you start knitting and did you have any gross misconceptions before like me?

Love,

V
