I used to think knitting was for grandmas and girls who thought that they were cool for doing grandma like things. I apologize to all knitters for being so judgey. Y'all were right. Knitting is the bomb, and I am so thankful for all of the great knitters out there who have made countless YouTube videos and free knitting patterns to teach people like me. Thank you!

That said, my knitting level currently sits at about a 3 out of 10, so you won't find original patterns on here anytime soon. However, I found this [gorgeous pattern](http://www.stinemah.no/?p=293) on [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/revarmer-turban) last week and had to make it. Unfortunately it's written in Norwegian, which I do not speak. So I faced one of those life altering, tough decisions, do I, a novice knitter who struggles to read patterns written in english, try to find something else I like as much, or do I press on and risk a massive headache.

# Staring at a new knitting pattern that I can't read

I slowly typed it from the PDF into Google Translate, got a hodgepodge of stuff out the other side, then slowly pieced it together into a knitting pattern that I think makes sense. The pattern is great, Google translate however could use a little work. So I thought I would save you all the trouble of going through all of that work. If I've already done it once, why should you have to do it again?

 Remember, I'm a beginner here, so there may be some errors or things that I misunderstood. PLEASE point them out to me so I can learn! That said, this pattern is a variation of one I've seen [elsewhere](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cabled-turban-2) and already in english, so if you would like a more trustworthy pattern check it out. Here is my translation of the gorgeous pattern:

# Cabled Ear Warmer Pattern

Yarn: 50g Puno Metallic ([this is what she used](http://www.raumaull.no/produkter/garn) -or- [this is what I used](http://www.lionbrand.com/yarn/wool-ease-yarn.html))
Needles: 6mm/US size 10 round or double-pointed needles + a cable needles

Start by casting 17 stitches onto the size 10 needles. Work back and forth. (This is the part where I get a little confused, I believe it means a single garter stitch on each end of the piece) The first and last stitch in each row will be a knit stitch. These stitches have been omitted from the pattern, but don't forget them.

Starting:

![project1start](/images/Project 1/project1start_Fotor.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

* Row 1: K1, P1, K4, P1, K1, P1, K4, P1, K1
* Row 2: K over K, P over P (Is there a better way to say this?)
* Row 3: K1, P1, m1, K4, P1, m1, K1, m1, P1, m1, K4, m1, P1, K1
* Row 4: P1, K2, P4, K2, P2, K2, P4, K2, P1
* Row 5: K1, P2, K1, m1, K2, m1, K1, P2, K2, P2, K1, m1, K2, m1, K1, P2, K1
* Row 6: P1, K2, P6, K2, P2, K2, P6, K2, P1

Pattern:
![project1firstround](/images/Project 1/project1firstround_Fotor.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

* Row 7: K1, P2, slip 3 st onto cable needle in front or work, K3 from left needle, K3 from cable needle, P2, K2, P2, K6, P2, K1
* Row 8-10: K over K, P over P
* Row 11: K2, P2, K6, P2, K2, P2, slip three stitches onto cable needle in front of work, K3 from left needle, K3 from cable needle, P2, K1
* Row 12-14: K over K, P over P
Repeat rows 7-14 for a total of ten twists on each side, which should be 86 rows if my math is correct.

Finishing:

![project1finishing_Fotor](/images/Project 1/project1finishing_Fotor.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

* Row 87: K1, P2, slip 3 st onto cable needle in front or work, K3 from left needle, K3 from cable needle, P2, K2, P2, K6, P2, K1
* Row 88: K over K, P over P
* Row 89: K1, P2, K2Tog, K2, K2Tog, P2, K2, P2, K2Tog, K2, K2Tog, P2, K1
* Row 90: K over K, P over P
* Row 91: K1, P2Tog, K4, P2Tog, K2Tog, P2Tog, K4, P2Tog, K1
* Row 92: K over K, P over P
Bind off. I used a mattress seem to join the ends here. Then weave in ends.

Band Piece:
![project1bandpiece_Fotor](/images/Project 1/project1bandpiece_Fotor.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

* Cast 8 stitches onto size 10 needles. Knit 22 rows of stockinette stitch. Bind off.

Take your main piece and flip in inside out. Wrap the band piece around the skinny part where the seam sits. Again, I used the mattress seem here, but I'm not certain that was the best choice. Then make sure all your ends are woven in, and you're done!
