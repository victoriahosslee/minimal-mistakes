This book has changed my life. I know, I know, it seems silly and I sound overly dramatic, but it's honestly the truth.

["The Power of Biblical Thinking"](http://www.ccel.us/power.toc.html)

Before this I had tried a number of different devotional books at different stages of my life and not a single one of them stuck, which is crazy because usually if I read something it stick pretty well. I have relied on this skill to get me through many tests with not nearly enough prep time. So why is it that when I try to read about my faith, things go in one eye and out the other?

Did I not want to learn? No, I don't think so. This happened even when my relationship with God was in a great place.

Were they poorly written? No, I don't think that's it either. Some of these writers are world famous for changing people's walks with God.

So what was the problem? Honestly, I don't know, but I gave up on the whole genre.


Then at Christmas this year my mom gave hubbs and I this book. I happened to be in a solid spiritual drought at the time, so I didn't even hesitate to dive in. I set out to just read a page, maybe two, a night with extremely low expectations.
